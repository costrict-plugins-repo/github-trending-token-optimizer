"""Suite-wide guard: running the tests must never write to the working tree.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Twice in one day a pytest run destroyed real work:

  1. ``plugins/token-optimizer/skills/token-optimizer/scripts/benchmark.py``
     vanished from the working tree during a suite run (twice), and was restored
     by hand in commit "fix(parity): restore benchmark.py to plugins mirror".
  2. Worse because it was silent: an engineer edited
     ``plugins/token-optimizer/hooks/userpromptsubmit_runner.py``, ran the suite,
     and the suite regenerated that mirror from the canonical
     ``hooks/userpromptsubmit_runner.py``, discarding the edit. ``git status`` was
     clean afterwards, so nothing pointed at the loss.

The cause was anti-drift tests that proved "the committed mirror is reproducible"
by REGENERATING it in place and asserting ``git status`` was clean, plus README
tests that mutated ``README.md`` and restored it in a ``finally``. A suite that
rewrites the tree can eat uncommitted work with no error and no diff, and it
makes results order-dependent: a later parity test passes only because an earlier
test rewrote the tree under it.

WHAT THIS DOES
--------------
Fingerprints every git-TRACKED file at session start and again at session end,
then fails the run if any of them changed. The fingerprint is
``(sha256, inode, mtime_ns)``, not content alone, because the dangerous case is
the CONTENT-IDENTICAL rewrite: regenerating a mirror on an already-clean tree
changes nothing a hash can see, and only bites the engineer who happened to have
an uncommitted edit. Inode/mtime catch the write itself.

Tracked files only, so untracked scratch files, ``.pytest_cache``, build staging
dirs and briefs in progress are ignored -- the guard is about destroying work
under version control.

Set ``TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_TREE_GUARD_PER_TEST=1`` to fingerprint around EVERY test
instead of once per session. That attributes a mutation to the exact test that
caused it (it costs a few minutes on the full suite, so it is opt-in).

Set ``TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_TREE_GUARD=0`` to disable the guard entirely -- for the
one legitimate case, a deliberate negative test of the guard itself.
