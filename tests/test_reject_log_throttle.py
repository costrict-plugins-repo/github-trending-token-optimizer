"""Reject-log throttle and path sanitization.

The reject-log code lives inside the generated daemon script (an f-string in
measure.py's _generate_daemon_script), not at module level, so these tests
assert the contract against the generated source text -- the same approach
test_dashboard_regen_retry.py takes for the shipped JS.

The throttle was global (one trace every 30s regardless of path), so a
rejected toggle was invisible after a recent rejected regenerate. Now per-path.
The path was written unsanitized, so a CR in the request path could
inject/overwrite a log line via terminal carriage-return overprint. Now stripped.
